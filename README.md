                                                ##Introduction
       
This project is a powerful web application to help you comparing you to others on many fronts in terms of recreation activities followed by people around the world. Recreation is part of any human life. All human beings need some break from their hectic schedule to spend time on activities they enjoy like music, sports, dance, watching television etc. This boost their energy multifold.
As part of this project we have collected 130000+ instances of tweets across the globe using Twitter APIs in form of JSON file. The JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) data is one of lightweight data-interchange format. It is very easy to interpret by human beings as well as machines.
Now on top of this tweets we are analyzing various trends across the globe using Spark SQL. We have designed meaningful queries to analyze various recreational activities people of various age groups choose and talk about, across the world by using twitter data and designing meaningful queries.
Some of the recreational activities we analyzed are as follows:

•	Sports, Extreme Sports •	Travel, Trips, Adventure, Theme Parks, National Parks •	Watching, Listen, Eating activities •	Dancing, Yoga, Gym ,Relaxation activities •	Hobbies such as poetry, collection, DIY etc.

We particularly designed queries to analyze what all countries people involves in recreational activities and in turn revealing their work life balance. Also what all are the most popular activities, what king of age group they belong to, popular trending hashtags are part of this project.
